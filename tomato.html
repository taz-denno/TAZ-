 <p>Tomato is a crop which has high returns on investment (ROI), making it a suitable
    agribusiness crop. One tomato plant grown in the open can yield about 5kgs of tomatoes. At a
    spacing of 90×60cm, plant population per acre is about 7407. With average tomato market price
    of Ksh 20 per kg, cost of production of Ksh.148,140, the farmer can earn:
    </p>
    <p>(7407 × 5kg × Ksh.20 = Ksh.740,700) - 148,140= Ksh.592,560 from one acre of
        tomatoes</p>
        <p>It is not enough to get a nice job in the city, sit in the office and work day in day out, a
            good number of Kenyan young professional are realizing. Office work alone, according to them,
            makes one dull, unambitious and financially constrained to live a good life, therefore, one must
            have a "side hustle".
            A side hustle in the Kenyan street parlance means an activity or a job that one engages in
            besides his work to make extra money. Of the many "side hustles" the Kenyan young
            professionals, mainly men, are engaging in, farming is turning out to be a top choice.</p>
            <p>Lawyers, accountants, journalists, bankers, doctors, lecturers, fashion designers and
                information technologists all are venturing into farming as they realize how lucrative
                agribusiness is.
                While some are keeping livestock like chickens and rabbits, majority are leasing land
                outside Nairobi and growing fast-maturing horticultural crops that include tomatoes, capsicum
                and cabbages and traditional vegetables whose market is insatiable in the capital.</p>

<h2>Tips for better Tomato Farming</h2>
         
    <ol>
        <li><b>Don’t Crowd the Seedlings</b></li>
        <p>When close together, growth is inhibited and eventually leads to low yield. Many farmers
            crowd the plants aiming to increase production only get bring losses.</p>
            <li><b>Grow Vertically Rather than Horizontally</b></li>
            <p>Growing vertically increases production as the crop can grow up to 10 meters when
                vertical. Horizontal planting will use up more space and being close to the ground increases the
                chances of fungus and pathogen attacks.</p>
                <li><b>Prune for Better Tomato Farming</b></li>
                <p>Remove suckers that grow on the joint between two brunches. These suckers will never
                    bear fruit but only take away energy from the plant. This can also be done on the other parts of
                    the plant but be cautious not to remove productive parts.</p>
                    <li><b>Remove Leaves</b></li>
                    <p>As the plant begins to mature, the lower leaves will naturally begin to yellow and wilt.
                        This is perfectly normal, so pull these from the plant when they appear. It will keep the plant
                        fresh, looking good, and help ward off disease.</p>
        
    </ol>


           
            <h2>Why Tomato Farming businesses?</h2>
         <p>Starting a tomato farming business is a rewarding business that is not too expensive to
            start up. However, before you start your tomatoes business, find out what kind of tomatoes
            people usually want. This information can be gotten from those who supply seeds, as they will be
            able to tell you what is popular and what isn’t. Also, they will let you know the varieties that sell
            well; however, you will also need to ensure that the seeds you finally pick will grow well in your
            climate.
            This means you would need to check your soil, and make sure it is very healthy. For
            instance, if you intend to plant heirloom tomatoes, your soil will need to have lots of organic
            matter and humus, and also have a neutral Ph that is under 7.</p>
            <p>This will ensure that pests and disease problems for the tomatoes are reduced to the
                barest minimum. It is advisable you test your soil before planting; you can do this yourself or
                ensure that you take it to a soil laboratory to determine its health.
                Once your tomatoes are fully developed and ready for harvest, they will turn into their
                natural colors – red, yellow, purple, or pink. Once you have harvested them you can start selling
                them. However, you would need to have carried out due diligence and search for your customers
                so that you don’t just have your produce with no one willing to buy.</p>
           
        <h2>Ecological Requirements for successful
            cultivation</h2>   
        <ul>
            <li><b>Location for planting</b></li>
            <p>Water proximity should be as close as possible to the planting
                field to avoid added costs of pumping water. Although water tanks can be used and this is
                specifically suitable when using drip irrigation system.</p>
            <li><b>The previous crop planted</b></li>
            <p>Tomatoes should not be planted immediately after potatoes
                or pepper and a 3 month break should be observed. This is to minimize on risk of diseases and
                reduce costs on disease management.</p>
                <li><b>Topology</b></li>
                <p> Gently sloping land is best as it facilitates drainage during rainy periods
                    especially for open air method.</p>
                    <li><b>Soil</b></li>
                    <p>The soil should be deep well drained loam. The soil should be prepared well and
                        loosened and broken down well. The optimal pH for tomatoes is around 6-7.5. Soil analysis can
                        be done to determine this and help you come up with the list of required fertilizer to prepare the
                        land. If the pH is low, lime can be used to raise it and if high, gypsum can be used to lower it.
                        Tomato grows well on most mineral soils that have proper water holding capacity and
                        aeration, and are free of salt. It prefers deep, well drained, sandy loam soils. The upper layer
                        needs to be permeable.
                        Soil depth of 15 to 20 cm is needed to grow a healthy crop. In heavy clay soils, deep
                        ploughing allows better root penetration.
                        Tomato is moderately tolerant to a wide range of pH (level of acidity), but grows well in
                        soils with a pH of 5.5 – 6.8 with adequate nutrient supply and availability. Addition of organic
                        matter is, in general, favourable for good growth. Soils with very high organic matter content,
                        like peat soils, are less suitable due to their high water holding capacity and nutrient deficiencies.
                    </p>
                    <li><b>Temperature and light</b></li>
                    <p>Tomato requires a relatively cool, dry climate for high yield and premium quality.
                        However, it is adapted to a wide range of climatic conditions from temperate to hot and humid
                        tropical. The optimum temperature for most varieties lies between 21 and 24 °C.
                        The plants can survive a range of temperatures, but the plant tissues are damaged below
                        10 °C and above 38 °C.
                        Tomato plants react to temperature variation during the growth cycle, for seed
                        germination, seedling growth, flower and fruit set and fruit quality. If cool or hot weather spells
                        persist during flowering, pollen production will be low. This will influence fruit formation.
                        Light intensity affects the colour of the leaves, fruit set and fruit colour
                    </p>
                    <li><b>Water and humidity</b></li>
                    <p>A simple rule of thumb can be used to determine whether local water supplies are
                        sufficient for growing tomato. If there are herbaceous plants (plants with many thin leaves)
                        growing in the natural environment, it will be possible to grow tomato. You should be able to
                        count on at least three months of rain.
                        Water stress and long dry periods will cause buds and flowers to drop off, and the fruits
                        to split. However, if rains are too heavy and humidity is too high, the growth of mould will
                        increase and the fruit will rot.
                        Cloudy skies will slow down the ripening of tomatoes. However, adapted cultivars are
                        available. Seed companies have special tomato varieties for hot-humid climates.
