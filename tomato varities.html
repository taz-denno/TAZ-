    <h1>TOMATO VARIETIES</h1>
    <h2>Choice of varieties</h2>
                    <p>Which variety to choose depends on local conditions and the purpose of growing. Local
                        varieties (land-races) and improved (or commercial) varieties can be distinguished. They are the
                        result of a continuous process of selection of plants. Selection criteria are based on
                        characteristics such as type of fruit, shape of plant, vitality and resistance to pests and diseases,
                        but also on factors related to climate and management.
                        Farmers select varieties that perform best under the local conditions. Only fruits from the
                        best plants must be selected and kept for seeds for the subsequent season. Farmers may breed
                        their own cultivars, but it is a costly and risky process.
                    </p>
                    <p>Tomato breeding companies have produced F1-hybrids. These grow from seeds that have
                        been produced by controlled hand pollination of male and female parent lines. These hybrids
                        combine high yield, disease resistance and other plant and fruit characteristics.
                        In Kenya, more than 40% of the farmers use hybrids. When using hybrids, new seeds
                        should be purchased each season. This may cost more money, but the resistance against diseases
                        of hybrids means the tomato plants need less spraying with pesticides. The yields are also higher,
                        creating more opportunity to bring tomatoes to the market.
                        Resistant varieties have an in-built resistance, which is carried in the seed. Resistance to a
                        specific disease means that it is very difficult or impossible for a plant with this resistant
                        characteristic to get that particular disease. Resistance can be a result of various plant
                        characteristics. </p>
                        <p>Leaves can be densely covered with hairs so that certain insects do not like sitting on
                            them. Some colours can be unattractive to certain insects. Such characteristics are visible.
                            36
                            Most characteristics that contribute to resistance to fungal and virus resistance cannot be
                            seen. There are no varieties on the market that are resistant to all existing diseases and pests, but
                            you can buy seed from plants that are resistant to one or several diseases.
                            Many farmers in lowland grow local varieties of uncertain origin. They have somewhat
                            sour and bitter tasting fruits, small, round or flat, with many segments, and are especially suitable
                            for grinding with condiments for sauces. They give a better yield than most imported cultivars
                            under the heavy environmental stress of the rainy season</p>
                        

        <h2>Tomato Varieties in Kenya</h2>
        <p>There are many tomato varieties in Kenya. Some varieties mature faster and produce
            bigger fruit. They are more resistant to common tomato diseases. Some tomato varieties in
