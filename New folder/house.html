       <h2>Introduction</h2>
       <p> Housing is necessary to protect chicken against predators, thieves, bad weather and to provide shelter for egg laying and broody hens.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="hous">
       <h2>Site selection</h2>
       <p>
           <ul>
               <li>Location should be dry and flat</li>
                <li>Poorly drained sites should be avoided or alternatively the house can be elevated from the ground</li>
                <li>Select a secure site away from predators and thieves</li>
                <li>In rectangular houses the end walls should face an East-West direction</li>
                <li>Clear all grass and bushes for about 3 meters on all sides of the house to keep away rodents and reptiles</li>
                <li>Ensure winds ventilate the house without causing draughts (cold)</li>
                <li>To protect against build-up of disease causing agents and parasites the house must be easily accessible and easy to clean</li>
                <li>Poultry houses should have openings on either side for ventilation</li>
                <li>A hole or ridge on the roof will ensure proper ventilation and give light</li>
           </ul>
       </p>
    </div>
       <h2>Housing chicken</h2>
       <div class="hous">
       <h3>Building materials</h3>
       <p>
           <ul>
               <li>Use locally available material like timber, iron sheets, off-cuts and/or clay brick</li>
               <li>Remove all barks from wood to reduce the parasite load</li>
           </ul>
       </p></div>
       <div class="hous">
       <h3>Floor</h3>
       <p>
       <ul>
           <li>Use slatted or raised floors to remove droppings and avoid predators</li>
           <li>Remove any sharp edged objects from the floor to prevent possible injury</li>
           <li>A concrete floor is recommended for easy cleaning and disinfection</li>
           </ul>
       </p></div>
       <div class="hous">
       <h3><i>Litter</i></h3>
       <p>Litter should be provided on all deep litter floor systems and laying nests.Types of litter include:</p>
       <ul>
           <li>Wood shavings</li>
           <li>Shredded paper</li>
           <li>Hay</li>
       </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="hous">
       <h3><i>Lighting</i></h3>
       <p>
           <ul>
               <li>Mostly important for laying hens in controlling number and weight of eggs</li>
               <li>Light intensity should be such that a person can read a newspaper at the center of the house</li>
               <li> In a crowded house, transparent roofing sheets should be fitted to improve lighting</li>
               <li>Excessive lighting may lead to cannibalism and other vices</li>
           </ul>
       </p></div>
       <div class="hous">
       <h3><i>Perches</i></h3>
       <p>
           <ul>
               <li>Perches are important for chicken to roost on at night and during daytime.</li>
               <li>They also reduce boredom, which can lead to vices like pecking and fighting.</li>
               <li>Each one-meter perch may roost five adult birds.</li>
               <li>Perches are best made from rounded sticks, which match the size of the birdsâ€™ feet</li>
           </ul>
       </p></div>
       <div class="hous">
       <h3><i>Laying nests</i></h3>
       <p>Laying nests ease egg collection and help avoid dirty and cracked eggs and should be provided at the onset of laying (18 weeks of age).
   <ul>
       <li>Avoid placing nests on the ground or outside the chicken house as this will expose the eggs to predators and thieves</li>
       <li>Remove eggs continuously from the nests to stop hens from going broody
       </li>
       <li>Nests should be placed inside the chicken house and preferably above the ground</li>
       <li>Provide one laying nest for every 5 hens</li>
       <li>The front is about 30cm high and the back 45cm high</li>
       <li>To prevent egg eating, laying nests should be placed in dark areas of the house</li>
       <li>Brooding nests are individual nests and should be placed in quiet and dark places where they are easily removed for cleaning</li>
       <li>Once the hen is broody it may be necessary to move her to an isolated place to avoid other hens disturbing her or going broody as well</li>
   </ul>
       </p></div>
