        <h1>TOMATO FARMING BUSINESS PLAN</h1>
        <div class="column">
            <p>The best decision you would ever make before starting a business that you are serious
                about, and that you intend to make profit from, is having a business plan. A farm business is not
                something you just decide to start off without carrying out the necessary investigations that
                would ensure that you have knowledge of what you are going into. The findings from your
                investigation has to be written down somewhere, as well as what your thoughts are and how you
                intend to achieve them in your business.</p>
            <p>Your business plan should contain key components such as an executive summary, where
                your tomato farm is described holistically for investors to understand. Also, you would need to
                include components like your history, structure, vision, objectives and mission statements,
                products and services your farm intends to offer, location, as well as your overall strategy as a
                new entrant into the sector or industry you intend going into.
                </p>
            <p>Your plan also needs to include your intended target market – who and where your
                customers are, how you intend to address the market segments, the infrastructure you would
                require to meet the start-up requirements for your business, SWOT analysis, and who your major
                competitors are in the industry you intend going into, and how your strategies are better than
                theirs, and how you intend to become one of the industry’s leaders.
                You would also need to input your financial analysis – cash flow, projected income and
                expenditure, balance sheet for at least five years.</p>
            <p>Writing a business plan can be quite cumbersome especially when it gets to the
                financials. However, there are loads of business plan writers that you can approach for help in
                getting your business plan written; or you could decide to go online and download guiding
                templates that would help you put down a comprehensive business plan for your tomato farm</p>
        
                <h2>Cost Analysis for Tomato Business</h2>

            capital and labour intensive. However as regards the equipment, they are mostly a one-time
            purchase, but labour and other operating expenses are usually recurring, however, you would
            learn how to juggle your expenses so as to keep your overhead low.</p>
        <p>A tomato farming business is one where certain costs during start-up cannot be avoided.
            This is because the certain equipment you would use would be needed regardless of the scale of
            farm business you are running. Some of the items that you would need to ensure are in place if
            you intend to launch your tomato farming business in Kenya are as follows;</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Amount needed to buy or lease an acre of land depending on the size and location</li>
                <li>Cost of facility construction on land e.g greenhouse, fencing e.t.c</li>
                <li>Cost of seeds, fertilizer and pest & diseases control
                </li>

            start.
            </p>
        <h3>Financing Your Tomato Farming Business</h3>
        <p>The tomato farming business might be something different from what you are used to,
            especially if you have never done farming before. Most people have the idea of starting a tomato
            farm but never do, which might be due to a lot of things which always includes finance.
            However, before you can get financing for your tomato farming business, you would need to
            have carried out your research, and ensure that you would put in the necessary hard work that is
            required.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Approaching the bank for a loan for your farming business</li>
            <li>Raising money from personal savings and sale of personal stocks</li>
            <li>Applying for grants from relevant agriculturally inclined organizations</li>
            <li>Raising money from business partners</li>
            <li>Approaching investors for money</li>
            <li>Pitching your business idea to venture capitalists
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Choosing a Suitable Location for a Tomato Farming Business</h3>
   <p>The location you intend to use for your business is very important, especially if you
    intend on taking the business seriously and view it as a successful venture. To get a farm for your
    tomato business, you probably would need to buy acres of land on the outskirts of town if you
    live in a busy one.
    However, if you live in the countryside and have a whole land just sitting vacant doing
    nothing, you might after analyzing the soil and determining it healthy for planting start your
    tomato farming business.</p>
    <p>Another thing you would need to consider while searching for a location is how much
        budget you have got. If you do not have the necessary budget to purchase a suitable land, then
        you might consider leasing the land till you raise the money to own the land, or look for a fellow
        tomato farmer who would not mind sharing some acres with you, pool your resources together to
        get the land. However, if you prefer to operate on you farmland alone, you might need to source
        for finance from your investors.</p>
    <p>Another thing you would need to consider when seeking for a suitable location is if
        where you have eventually chosen has got healthy soil that will ensure that you grow healthy
        tomatoes for sale. If you eventually get a location, and the soil isn’t healthy for your tomatoes,
        you would have wasted money on a venture, except you sell off the land to someone else, while
        you seek another location.</p>
    <p>Finally, your location must be large enough to accommodate a storage facility for your
        harvested tomatoes, and also a space for office facilities so that you would be able to carry out
        the necessary paperwork.</p>
    

        <h3>Technical & Manpower Details</h3>
    <P>Farming of any kind is always a capital and intensive labour project, even if it is on a
        small scale. You would need tools to plough, plant, weed, keep the plants growing, and
        eventually harvesting your tomatoes. If you are lucky enough, you might be able to get these
        equipment for fairly use from farmers either offline or online that are looking to upgrade on the
        tools they have.</P>
    <h3>The Production Process in Tomato Farming Business</h3>
    <p>The production process involved in a tomato farming business is basically the same from
        the point of planting to the point of harvesting.
        The process include, getting tomato seeds, determining their viability, ensuring that your
        soil is of the required state to grow your tomatoes. Weeding and watering are also processes that
        are involved in producing your tomatoes, and finally harvesting when they are about to ripen.
        Other processes include packaging the tomatoes for either end customers, processing
        factories, for overseas customers, and so on.</p>
