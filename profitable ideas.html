                  <p>The number of farmers keeping chickens for profit has grown in the last five years. Chicken farming is prevalent across the country, both rural and urban. The increased quantity of chickens has also resulted in the emergence of extra marketing opportunities. The sale of eggs continues to be the most profitable aspect of chicken husbandry. In addition, with strong demand for white meat in various hotels and restaurants in metropolitan regions, the industry for broilers is growing.</p>

                <h3>POMEGRANATE</h3>
                <p>Kenya has discovered a new miraculous fruit. In Kenya, the pomegranate fruit. In Kenya, pomegranate fruit is a crimson fruit with a rough outer bark-like coating that originated in Persia a long time ago.
                  Pomegranate fruit is a sort of fruit seen on many people's borders in Kenya and was presumably devoured by birds before this discovery, but not now.
                  In Kenya, pomegranate fruit is a fruit the size of an apple with numerous little seeds covered by a covering that resembles twigs. In Kenya, people commonly swallow the seeds of pomegranate fruit or prepare juice with them.
                  Food scientists in Kenya recommend eating pomegranate fruit seeds when they are at their healthiest and juiciest.</p>

                <h3>TREE TOMATO</h3>
                <p>Tamarillo is a fast-growing tree that may reach heights of 2 to 5 meters and is well known in Kenya as "Tunda Nyanya" Depending on the caltivar, optimum output is attained after 3-6 years, and the lifespan is around 12 years. Typically, the tree has a single upright trunk with lateral branches. Each set, plants can yield 1 to 6 fruits. Despite cross-pollination, trees are still able to produce fruits, but the blossoms are aromatic and draw pollinators. Fertilization looks to be improved by cross-pollination.</p>
